{{ description }}.

## Dataset
- Uses the `{{ dataset_name }}` dataset (default: Iris) for quick classification/regression experiments.
- Keep raw data under `data/raw/` and processed features under `data/processed/`.

## Project layout
- `src/{{ package_name }}/` — package entrypoint for data prep, feature engineering, and modeling code.
- `configs/` — configuration stubs for experiments and training runs.
- `data/raw` and `data/processed` — input data and intermediate artifacts (tracked via placeholders).
- `models/` — saved model binaries or checkpoints.
- `notebooks/` — exploratory work; keep them lightweight.
- `reports/` — experiment summaries and plots.
- `scripts/` — CLI utilities (data download, training, evaluation).
- `tests/` — unit and integration tests.

## Getting started
1) Create a virtual environment and install your chosen dependency manager (to be added in later steps).
2) Populate `configs/base.yaml` with experiment settings (seed, paths, model defaults).
3) Add data prep and training code in `src/{{ package_name }}/`.

## Template usage (Copier)
This project was generated from the local Copier template in `template_mlops/`.

To create a new project from the template:
```bash
copier copy --trust --defaults template_mlops your-new-project
```
Customize answers during the prompt or pass `--data key=value` flags to override defaults.
